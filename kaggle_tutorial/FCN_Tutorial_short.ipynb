    "Although we use binary accuracy in this tutorial, be aware that it is a misleading metric to measure performance in this context. In our LV segmentation task, every pixel has an associated class label: 0 for background and 1 for LV. But less than 2 percent of all pixels in the Sunnybrook dataset correspond to the LV class. This is a classic class imbalance problem, where the class distribution is highly skewed and binary accuracy is not a meaningful performance metric. Suppose a model simply predicts all pixels to be background, then its accuracy performance is still greater than 0.98, even though the model is not able to actually detect pixels belonging to the LV object. The reader is encouraged to consider the following alternative performance metrics for LV segmentation: [S&oslash;rensenâ€“Dice index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) and [average perpendicular distance](http://smial.sri.utoronto.ca/LV_Challenge/Evaluation.html)."

    "### Step 3: Apply trained Caffe FCN model to compute EF\n",
    "This step shows how one can apply the Caffe FCN model trained on the Sunnybrook dataset to the DSB dataset for LV segmentation and EF calculation. This process can be considered as a form of *transfer learning*, where the task is to transfer the learned representation from one dataset to another with the goal of detecting similar representation across datasets. In order to proceed with this step, we need two additional files: `fcn_deploy.prototxt` and `fcn_iter_15000.caffemodel`. The file `fcn_deploy.prototxt` is manually derived from the train net file `fcn_train.prototxt` by discarding the `data` layers and converting the `SoftmaxWithLoss` layer to the `Softmax` layer. Once created, the deploy protobuf looks like this:"

We use the Caffe model at the final snapshot iteration 15000, `fcn_iter_15000.caffemodel`, to perform LV segmentation and compute EF on the DSB dataset. We borrow the following code snippets from [Alex Newton's tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/details/fourier-based-tutorial) to accomplish this step. First, we load a DSB dataset (e.g., the training set) using the `Dataset` class.

We can reduce the processing time if we enable the code sections above to perform *batch* processing. The code is currently configured to call Caffe and transfer data between CPU and GPU for *each* image. While data processing on the GPU is extremely fast, the constant data communication overhead negates some of the speed benefits. Batch processing can be done, for example, by batching all DICOM images belonging to a SAX study in a big NumPy stack and calling Caffe via `net.forward_all()` to load the NumPy stack into the GPU for batch processing. Although enabling batch processing will likely complicate the code, keep in mind that speed and efficiency will become critical as your model grows in complexity and size; it can be discouraging to try many experiments if an experiment takes a few hours to complete. Finally, remember to check the file `logs.txt`. This code is equipped to handle exceptions and errors associated with the DSB dataset. Upon inspection of the logs, we discover that a good amount of examples in the DSB training set contain irregularities. It is also likely that the validation and testing sets contain similar irregularities. The reader should do their best to handle these situations."
